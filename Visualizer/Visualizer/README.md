# Visualizer Application
This repository contains the source code for a visualizer application built using Qt, OpenGL, and various geometry algorithms. The application allows users to visualize and manipulate geometric shapes, curves, and perform operations like reading and displaying STL files.

## Features
OpenGL Visualization: The application utilizes the Qt framework and OpenGL for rendering geometric shapes and curves.

Bezier Curve: Create Bezier curves by specifying control points.

Hermite Curve: Generate Hermite curves using control points and tangent vectors.

B-Spline Curve: Design B-Spline curves with a set of control points.

Z-Buffer: Read and display STL files using Z-Buffer algorithm.

Color Palette: Choose colors for rendering shapes and curves.

## Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AnkitDhayal/VisualizerQT/new/main/Visualizer/visualizer-app.git
cd visualizer-app
## Build and Run:

Open the project in your preferred IDE or build tool compatible with Qt projects. Build and run the application.

Create Geometric Shapes:

Click the "ADD" button to add 2D points to the list.
Use the "Bezier Curve" button to create Bezier curves.
Use the "Hermite Curve" button to generate Hermite curves.
Use the "BSplineCurve Curve" button to design B-Spline curves.
Read and Display STL Files:

Click the "Read STL File" button to read an STL file using the Z-Buffer algorithm.
Click the "Show STL File" button to display the read STL file.
Color Palette:

Click the "Color" tab to access the color palette.
Choose a color using the color dialog.
The selected color will be used for rendering shapes and curves.
Dependencies
Ensure that your system has the necessary dependencies installed, including Qt, OpenGL, and any additional libraries required by your development environment.
